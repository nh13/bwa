first run prepare_seq_data.sh to get some test sequence data ready

test_diff.sh can be used to time your branch and compare differences
between your branch of bwa and another

e.g. also git clone lh3's bwa branch in a seperate dir.
and run from this test directory:
test_diff.sh -a ${path_to}lh3/bwa

test_prof.sh can be used to gather profiling information
(again run from this test directory)
